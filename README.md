# SKY-Ex-marching-cubes-lookup-tables
This is a Godot C# repository, with files that may have been from SKY-Ex, they are unused in the official game, but can be helpful.
The ImmediateGeometryTest file has the marching cubes code, along with the look-up tables, so as the comments of the people which it was gotten from.
The file however does not work in Godot Mono 3.2.2, reason is unknown as of now, but maybe it can work in other apps.

Attribution is appreciated.
Thank you.
